# Alexandria Edwards

Hi there! My name is Alexandria Edwards and Welcome to my site! I'm a Technical Consulting Engineer, an Agile
Scrum Master, and a InfoSec enthusiast and now a Junior Full Stack Developer!

I recently took a Coding Boot Camp at GaTech and boy was it a RIDE! The course offered an intense immersion
into Front End and Back End technologies such as HTML5/es6, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, Node.js,
React.js, MySQL, AJAX, APIs, Angular! Throughout the journey, I have learned how to incorporate different
libraries to build repsonsive and appealing UIs. I have also learned incorporating libraries such as
Bootstrap and Materialize to develop beautiful and appealing UIs. Who knew how BOLD, creative, and
imaginative, the coding process could be!

Below you will find a compilation of my code, from the beginning of the course to the end. Please click on
the links to see the deployed versions of my work or check out my code on GitHub! Thanks you so much for
stopping by and have a joyous day!
